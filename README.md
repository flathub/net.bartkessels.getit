# GetIt

___Send HTTP requests to API endpoints___

GetIt's main focus is to make your life a lot easier when you have to test APIs or use somebody else's API. We know it can be hard to find a great, simple and open source application for this task that's not command line based.

You can send numerous requests to a webserver. You can send RAW post data, form post data, add cookies to your request and add headers to your request.

The response can be viewed either as syntax highlighted code, with JSON even being made readable, as the raw output, which means no syntax highlighting, and view it in a webview.
